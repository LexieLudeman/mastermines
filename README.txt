MasterMines - Krista Dunlap, Lexie Ludeman, Toby Crocker	

Description and Gameplay:
	MasterMines is an implementation of the classic strategy game of a similar name.  A round is initialized when the user selects between two difficulty levels, easy and hard.  The game will generate a random, four-color code selected from 6 options.  There are no duplicate colors or blank spaces allowed in the code.  A timer will begin counting as soon as the mode is selected.  The user may then begin making attempts to determine the secret code, using the mouse to select four colors in the order which seems most correct.  On ‘easy’ mode, the user will have ten chances.  On ‘hard’ mode the user will have 8 chances.  Following the user’s first guess, a window will appear at the top of the game board that tracks used guesses and remaining guess count.  After each guess, the permutation entered by the user will be added to the game board.  To the right of the displayed guess, four symbols will appear to indicate how closely the selected permutation matches the secret code.  Each green check-mark signifies a correctly chosen color has been placed in the proper index.  Each red ‘X’ indicates a position filled by a color that is not in the secret code.  The orange hyphen denotes the condition of a properly chosen color in the wrong index.  Using the clues provided, the user must deduce the secret code before running out of guesses.  The game ends when the user successfully determines the code, or runs out of guesses.  In the former case, their performance is scored and passed to the leaderboard.  The latter case brings humiliation and dishonor.  In both cases the time elapsed will appear in a window over the game board, with an option to start a new game.

Scoring:
	The user’s score is a function of unused guesses, and inverse of the time elapsed.  Correctly wielding logical prowess and using time efficiently is greatly rewarded.  Additionally, the user receives a bonus multiplier by selecting the more difficult mode, allowing fewer guesses.

Implementation:
	HTML code for the project exists in the index.html file, comprising the foundational skeleton for the styling and logic.  The HTML file adheres to the ‘semantic elements’ paradigm as described in the W3Schools HTML5 tutorial.  Semantic elements allow for easier-reading code, as well as making it easier for search engines to identify correct pages and content.  Semantic elements make for a more organized page which makes styling and scripting much easier.  The HTML code also adheres to the styling guide provided in the W3schools HTML5 tutorial, and passes the appropriate validation services (including accessibility).
	The MasterMines stylesheet is linked in the HTML header.  Within, the styling for elements described in index.html including the canvas, the feedback images, and the instructions.  In order to create a more magical feel, we styled the h1 header with an animation that gradually changes it’s color.  One can’t be styling without matching colors, so we added a transition effect to the instructions on hover but with the same color scheme.  A third styling feature added to the names of the MasterMine architects causes them to jump out of the screen a bit, to emphasizing and drawing attention!  The stylesheet passes W3 validation also.
	Game logic and the High Score API are also linked in index.html, and jQuery included for the proper function of the scoring API.  The mastermines.js file comprises the majority of the heavy lifting for the project.  The logic that draws the color options on the canvas for entering each guess, and for displaying each guess; the logic tying the feedback images to the potential guess conditions and when to display which, and where;  the click listeners for each color button; the functions handling the timer and scoring; logic for setting the mode; logic for changing the color of clicked boxes; win condition checking; guess count incrementing and display;  menus, new game refresh, time display, etc.  Calculations for drawing each color, for adding click listeners, and the logic for displaying feedback images all required great care and attention to detail in implementation.

Conclusion:
	MasterMines is an engaging game in a simple, yet appealing environment.  The color scheme is relaxing, soothing stressed users as they battle against time and mystery.  Playing MasterMines is challenging and fun.  All aspects function smoothly, as expected, and although instructions are provided on the page gameplay has an intuitive feel.  MasterMines is just difficult enough to feel rewarding when solved, but not so hard as to be impossible.  The scoring scale is logical and just, allowing for a wide spread based upon performance so that truly masterful intellects will be able to claim bragging rights.  Guess counts are set appropriately to give the user a fair chance while also posing a worthy obstacle.  There can only be one MASTERMINER, but we (the MasterMines team) feel safe betting that you can’t just play once!
